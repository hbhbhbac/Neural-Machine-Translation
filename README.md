Neural Machine Translation with Sequence to Sequence RNN and Deeplearning4j

I present here a Deeplearning4j-based implementation of a Neural Machine Translation with Sequence to Sequence RNN. This implementation is based on the exemple that modeles the sequence to sequence RNNs used for the addition operation which can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples/tree/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/recurrent/seq2seq).
